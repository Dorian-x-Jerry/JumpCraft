Jerry Jan 5 5:19pm. combined gravity and collision code to make rough demo of game jumping mechanics

Dorian jan 5 11:18 pm. tweaked gravity—collision with the top of walls will reduce yVelocity, instead of allowing the slime to essentially float. Found a bug: person will fall out of platforms—intended??

Dorian jan 6 12:02 am. fixed bug. collision physics should be all good now.

Dorian jan 7 12:04 am. Added winner() function and changed jump key to space. When you goto the very right of the screen. press E and it will check if you win. If not, it will print nothing. If you win, it will print ("you win")
