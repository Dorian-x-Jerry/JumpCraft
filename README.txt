Responsibilities
Dorian: Movement and collision physics (including building and sliding on ramps), title + end screen layout and functionality (mousePressed/Released methods), background design and implementation, bug fixing, win-check function
Jerry: Level design and creation (rectangles), graphics implementation (skins, level walls and ramps, portals, etc.), skin selection layout and functionality

How to play
Controls are displayed on main menu when the game is first started. Click "skins" button to select one of six player icons, which will take you back to the main menu. Click "start" to start Level 1 and maneuver your way to the portal in the top right corner. Repeat for other levels. Beat Level 3 to win the game. No pauses, no in-game menu, no level selection. Beat all three levels successively to beat the game.

Functionalities
Missing: Idle/jump animation and transition between maps (both extra and unecessary components)
Added: Minecraft-themed everything (graphics, level backgrounds and objects, skins, etc.), mystery easter egg???

Known bugs/errors
None

Additional info
Rather than add extra ornamental features, we focused on catching and fixing bugs and polishing our game in order to deliver on what we set out to do at the beginning of the project. The result was a simple yet very cohesive and complete game, which we believe is much better than having a messy game wtih many features.

P.S. click on the Nether potal in Level 1 and something cool might happen...
